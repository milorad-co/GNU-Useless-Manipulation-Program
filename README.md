# GNU Useless Manipulation Program
A very bad art program, but still better than [DuckDood's readST](https://github.com/DuckDood/readST).
# How to Install
## For Linux and Windows
GUMP is intended for Debian-based Linux distros and Windows 11 (although it will likely work fine on Windows 10).
1. Install the [Milorad Application Installer](https://github.com/milorad-co/milorad-installer) for the corresponding OS.
2. Run the command `sudo milorad install gump`.
## Developer GUMP
If you want access to the YYP of GUMP, or want to get access to GUMP's latest versions faster, you may install the developer pre-release.
1. Install [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en/download) if you do not already have it.
2. Install the [Milorad Application Installer](https://github.com/milorad-co/milorad-installer) for the OS you are using.
3. Run the command `sudo milorad install gump-dev`.
